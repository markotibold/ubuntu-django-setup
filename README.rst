Ubuntu 10.4 Django Development Setup
====================================

A simple reference guide for quickly setting up an ubuntu Virtual Machine in Fusion specifically for
developing Django web applications.


Fusion
------

Setup a virtual machine in Vmware Fusion. I prefer bridged network mode and making use of shared folders.

In the vmware terminal follow these steps::

	* sudo apt-get install git-core

	* git clone https://github.com/markotibold/ubuntu-django-setup && cd ubuntu-django-setup	

	* ./install.sh


VmWare tools
````````````

If you want'm, install'm like so::

	sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`

	Install Vmware Tools from fusion

	sudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom 
	
	sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom

	tar -xvf /media/cdrom/Vm[..].gz

	run the install script as super user


Keys
----

Add your public key to the authorized keys::

	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@host 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

If you want to reuse your ssh-keys that you already have installed on your Mac, just scp them to the VM::

	scp -r ~/.ssh/id_rsa* user@host:
		

Folder sharing
--------------

If you keep your git repo's in ~/devshare on your Mac, this is what you'll probably want to do:

	ln -s /mnt/hgfs/devshare/


Notes
-----

* If you use Sequel Pro, connect using ssh to save yourself the hassle of granting permissions
